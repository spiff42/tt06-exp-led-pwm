## How it works

The LED PWM Controller currently takes 8 bits from ui[7:0] and generates
a PWM signal with that duty cycle on uo[0].

## How to test

Setting the DIP switches results in changing the brightness of segment A
(top) on the 7-segment display.

## External hardware

Currently no external hardware is supported.
